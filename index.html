    <h1>My Journey into Tech</h1>
    
    <h2>From Curiosity to Coding</h2>

    <p>Meet Emmanuella, a young woman who 
        recently decided to embark on a new and exciting journey 
        into the world of <b>technology</b> and <b>coding.</b> She had always 
        been curious about how websites and applications worked, but never 
        imagined she would start learning how to build them herself.
    </p>
    <h3> The First Steps </h3>

        <p> Emmanuella began by learning the basics of HTML, the foundation of web development.
             She created her first web page, adding headings, paragraphs, 
             and even formatting her text using <b>bold,</b>italic, and <u>underline</u> elements.
            Every new tag she learned brought a sense of accomplishment.
            She quickly became comfortable with HTML elements and is eager to explore more.
          Next on her list: learning more HTML elements and CSS to style her web pages!</p>
   
    <h3>Challenges and Growth</h3>

        <p>The journey wasn't always easy. Emmanuella encountered errors, bugs, and challemges that tested her patience.
            <b>But she never gave up. </b>She knew that with every mistake, she was one step closer to becoming
            a confident coder.
            At the end of this program, Akua can build web pages and will slowly venture into <i>JavaScript</i> to make her projects interactive.
        </p>
    
    <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>

        <p>Emmanuella knows that the road to mastering tech is long, but she is excited for the future. 
            She's even started sharing her progress on social media to inspire others,
            especially other women, to dive into the world of coding.
        </p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Emmanuella's journey is just beginning.
             With passion, determination and the ability to <u>never stop learning,
             </u>she knows that the possibilities in tech are endless.</p>
